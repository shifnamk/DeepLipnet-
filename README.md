# Lipreading Model

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for training and deploying a lipreading model based on deep learning techniques. The model is designed to transcribe spoken words from visual cues of lip movements extracted from video sequences.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lipreading-model.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Training
1. Prepare the training dataset of annotated video frames and corresponding transcripts.
2. Run the training script:
   ```
   python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```
   Adjust the dataset path, number of epochs, and batch size as needed.

### Inference
1. Prepare the input video file containing lip movements.
2. Run the inference script:
   ```
   python inference.py --video /path/to/video.mp4
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/video.mp4` with the path to your input video file.

## Model Deployment
1. Containerize the trained model using Docker:
   ```
   docker build -t lipreading-model .
   ```
2. Deploy the Docker container to a cloud-based infrastructure such as AWS or Azure.
3. Expose the model functionality through a RESTful API endpoint.
